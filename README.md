# ntd - not std

ntd (acronym: **n**ot s**td**) is a library which adds functionality to C++ which should be included in the standard lib by default (IMHO).

**Note:** This library is using some shiny new C++14 features, so you'll need a C++14 compatible compiler.

## Dependencies

**None**, at least if you're only using the library. If you plan to compile the unit tests you'll need the unit test framework: [mavis](http://mavis.kasoki.de).

## What stuff does ntd contain?

* curry, ``ntd/curry.hpp``

## License

ntd is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. For more information check out the ``LICENSE`` file.
